BUGS
====
* Display loading screen after intro, while map is being parsed; absorb clicks during this time. Background-load map?
* Display "click/tap to continue" on dialogs when relevant
* Question menus should explain how to use them
* Have some animation on intro text, e.g. characters being displayed as if typed
* Respond to drags even when they go outside the viewport.
* When spoken to, Linus should (sometimes) repeat the mission he just sent you on, e.g., "What are you waiting for? Go talk to them!"
* Add (very brief) gameplay instructions to the intro screen.
* The various "git push" interactions produce multiple entries on the task list, when they should produce only one.
* When the player earns coins; there should be a dialog saying "You earned X coins" or similar.
* Some of the later interactions don't refer the player to the next one.
* Interactions involving multiple questions should be resumable from just before the last incorrectly-answered one.
* Implement Linus helping the player when the player is stuck.
* Make sure task list updates only happen when NPCs mention the corresponding task.
