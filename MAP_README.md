Note that if you're going to edit the map, you need to export both a png and a
jpg version, due to limitations of the ipad (the ipad has a max support file
sized AND a max supported pixel resolution).

once you've created your map:

1. export a full-res png version for use on the desktop.
2. export a half-res (exactly 50% height and 50% width) jpg version for use on
   ipad. You may need to play with the "quality" setting to ensure that the
   resulting jpg is less than 500kB.
